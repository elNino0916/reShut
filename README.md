## About

reShut is a **WinUI 3 desktop application** built on top of **reShut CLI** (currently **v2.0.5**).  
It brings most of the CLI’s core functionality into a **modern, intuitive graphical interface**, making it easier to manage remote systems without relying on command-line tools.

This project is also a **learning exercise**:
- Development has only just started
- The initial layout was created with the help of AI
- I am currently learning **XAML** and **WinUI 3**, so feedback and suggestions are welcome

---

## Current State

- ✅ GUI wrapper around reShut CLI
- ✅ Basic reboot and shutdown management
- ⚠️ Incomplete feature set
- ⚠️ UI and UX still evolving
- ⚠️ Not yet stable

---
## Build instructions
To test the current version, clone the repository and open it with the **latest** version of Visual Studio (preferably 2026).
Wait for it to initialize and press Run. Try to install WinUI3 in VS Installer if issues occur.
